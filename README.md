## üíª Published Work on GitHub  
My GitHub hosts several proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits and advanced tools, including but not limited to:

- **CVE-2025-36041 IBM MQ SSL Bypass Exploit**  
  A PoC that bypasses SSL certificate validation in IBM MQ by injecting fake SSL repositories.

- **Path Traversal PoC for M-Files**  
  Demonstrates a file traversal vulnerability via REST API payload injection to access sensitive files.

- **CVE-2025-2783 Chrome Sandbox Escape Simulation**  
  An educational sandbox escape simulation illustrating how improper Mojo IPC handle validation could allow sandbox breakout.

- **XenoCute Exploitation Framework**  
  A multi-vulnerability exploit suite targeting CuteNews CMS, including RFI, XSS, RCE, and more.

- **PacketMist (Free Version)**  
  Open-source ARP spoofing and MITM network tool supporting packet fragmentation and MAC address spoofing.

- **Dirty Pipe Linux Kernel Exploit**  
  A local privilege escalation exploit leveraging pipe buffer vulnerabilities to gain root access.

‚Ä¶and many more.
